    "# Coursework Part 1: Detecting Spam with Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the tasks for IN432 Big Data coursework 2019, part 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This coursework is about classification of e-mail messages as spam or non-spam in Spark. We will go through the whole process from loading and preprocessing to training and testing classifiers in a distributed way in Spark. We wil use the techniques shown in the lextures and labs. I will also introduce here a few additional elements, such as the NLTK and some of the preprocessing and machine learning functions that come with Spark. You are not expected to need anything beyond the material handed out so far and in some cases the Spark documentation, to which I have put links in this document.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure is similar to the lab sheets. I provide a code structure with gaps that you are supposed to file. In addition you should run 2 small experiments and comment on the results. The lines where you are supposed to add code or take another action are marked with \">>>\" \n",
    "please leave the \">>>\" in the text, comment out that line, and write your own code in the next line using a copy of that line as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have added numerous comments in text cells and the code cells to guid you through the program. Please read them carefully and ask if anything is unclear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the tasks, don't delete the outpus, but downlaod the notebook (outputs will be included) and upload it into the coursework submission area on Moodle. The coursework part counts for 50% or the total coursework."

    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression outperformes Naive Bayes and SVM for allmost all data sizes, i.e. n and for different experients. Also for each model, training accuracy is higher than testing accuracy. at n = 3, all three model's training and testing accuracy is at 83.4%. The rule is; an increase in vector size should give an increase in classification accuracey which proofs to be the case above, this is due to the effect of hashing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector Size: \n",
    "An increase in vector size should yield an increase in training/testing accuracy as hashing maps each word in text to a positin in a vector which leads to data being spread out and hence collisions become less fequent. collisions should be avoided as they cause misclassifications. \n",

    "Classifiers can yield very accurate results if more data is used. Banko and Brill (2001) proof that having less  than one million words in a text can cause greater variation in the performance of classifiers, this sheds light on why SVM's accuracy did not improve and on the difference between LR and NB.  \n"
